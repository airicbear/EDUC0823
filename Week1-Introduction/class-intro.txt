Hi, I'm Eric Nguyen and I'm a Junior at Temple studying Data Science.
I also work as a student worker over at the Scholars Studio in the Charles Library.

In Freshman year, I lived in Johnson Hall which was a great experience and I met a lot of friends there but since then I've been living off-campus in my own apartment.
Since I don't have a meal plan any longer, I'm trying to learn how to cook.

So far, I've been able to cook fried rice as well as mac and cheese, but I definitely want to expand my cooking knowledge, so if you have any easy recipes feel free to reply any suggestions you have.

A bit of background about myself, I grew up in Paoli, PA which is a suburban town roughly 40 minutes West of Philadelphia and I went to Conestoga High School.

Since freshman year of highschool, one of the hobbies I found has been in breakdancing or as I call it, bboying.
My strongest bboy moves are probably the backspin and the airchair.
I've started practicing with my friends over at the Temple Breakers club recently and I think the next move I want to get down is the flare.
I've been practicing flares on and off for the past several years but its still hard.

Another hobby of mine which I've been doing since around 7th grade is computer programming.
Specifically, I really enjoy making websites and also mobile apps and sometimes video games.
One website I'm proud of making is a Karaoke website that I made this past summer.
I made it because my family has a Karaoke night every Friday and I wanted to store a list of songs that we could use.
